These files were copied from the Corda Tokens SDK (https://github.com/corda/token-sdk), 
to be able to annotate them with ZKP annotations and use them in tests as a representative 
example of what want to be able to support in ZKFlow. 

They are not part of the ZKFlow distribution, since they are part of test fixtures only.
